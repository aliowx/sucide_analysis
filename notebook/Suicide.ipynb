By reports the V has history of depression and past suicidal ideation.  The V was angry over a 2 year long distance internet relationship that had ended the evening prior.  The V and partner had exchanged numerous text messages regarding their relationship in which the V relayed that she was going to commit suicide.   Given the nature of the evidence and no indications of trauma or foul play at the scene this death is a suicide by hanging / asphyxiation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
       "LE responded to a scene of a reported suicide. Upon arrival, LE was directed to a bedroom on the second story of the residence. V, a XX XX, was at his friend's house. The friend reported that the two were drinking alcohol and hanging out when V pulled a gun out, put it in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. When V's mother was notified, she told LE that V had been talking about suicide and acting weird that day. There are no signs of foul play. Death was ruled a suicide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "The XX XX victim was in his vehicle with his girlfriend arguing when she broke up with him and left the vehicle, walking away from it. A few moments later, she heard a gunshot and realized that the victim had shot himself with his .45 caliber handgun. Police responded and did not attempt intervention as the victim was clearly deceased. The handgun was found in his lap and he had entrance and exit wounds on each side of his head. The bullet appeared to exit through the drivers side window of the vehicle and the empty casing was in on the passenger side floor. There was one live round in the firearm. The girlfriend did not know of any other reason besides the breakup that the victim might have killed himself. They had been staying with friends for a while, who stated that the victim talked to them about dealing with depression and anxiety (unknown treatment status) and they suspected some of it may have stemmed from his time in the military, and they said the victim and the girlfriend had been arguing recently. He did not speak to anyone of suicide and no suicide note was found. The girlfriend stated that the victim did not drink alcohol and did not do drugs. No other circumstances are known.                                                                                                       1\n",
       "LE responded to the residence of this XX XX who was found by her uncle hanging by a rope on the back of a camping trailer.  The V's uncle stays at the property intermittently and had seen her a couple of nights ago.  She is a habitual user of methamphetamine and heroin and has struggled with addiction for several years.  She has attempted suicide in the past and was admitted to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation.The property was filled with several junk vehicles, trash and debris.  The area outside the trailer was littered with drug paraphernalia including burnt foil and used syringes.
